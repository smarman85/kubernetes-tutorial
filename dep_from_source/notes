docker build -t hello-webapp:v1 .

run container:
docker run -d -p 80:8080 hello-webapp:v1

kubernetes takes care of all the details of running a container
for kubernetes to know how to run a container, you need a Kubernetes manifest

cat deployment.yaml
	- written in yaml
	- cont. key info about your service
		* pointer to Docker image
		* memeory/CPU limits
		* ports exposed

We now need one more comp, before we can actually run our container *** a container registry
